# Drone Delivery in India

Countries like USA, Canada & UK have seen drone delivery a long time back. Companies like Amazon(Prime Air), UPS Airlines have already done and are using drones for faster delivery. The big question that lies is that **when can we expect drone delivery in India?** and most importantly, **why haven't we seen drone delivery in India yet?** <br/>
There is no autonomous drone delivery in India yet. Let us know why.

## The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)

It is a Government body under the **Ministry of Civil Aviation** for the regulation of civil aviation. They had a policy: [Drone Regulation 1.0](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183093) - The policy had some rules and regulations for safe flying of drones in India. <br/>
Then in January 2019 came the [Drone Policy 2.0](https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/indian-government-announces-drone-policy-2-0/) which made conditions favorable for Drone Aviation in India. <br/>
The DGCA selected 7 out of 34 companies that applied for **Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight(BVLOS)** drone testing and experiments. The companies selected are Food Delivery companies like: **Zomato**, **Swiggy** & **Dunzo**, Medical Delivery companies like: **Zipline & Redwing**, large enterprises like **Tata Advanced Systems** and **Honeywell.**

## Testing/Experiments

Zomato successfully tested a payload delivery using a Hybrid Drone. It covered 5km in 10 minutes, carried a payload of 5kg and hit a maximum speed of 80kmph. Their reserach was backed by Ant Financial and Delivery Hero and a local drone startup TechEagle.

Thus, there is a great scope for Drone Delivery in India as the situation has improved recently. The Drone Policy 2.0 aims to set up an automatic air traffic management system for drones.

The areas will be divided into red, yellow and green zones. Drones will not be allowed in red zones which will include airstrips and airports, military areas, Parliament and other important goverment areas. The Government of India has proposed an app called the [Digital Sky Platform.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/drone-flying-legal-india-explained-1325244-2018-08-28) 
Before a flight, drone operators will have to apply for permission on the app. The request, the government says, will be accepted or denied instantaneously, as long as you are in the green zone.
